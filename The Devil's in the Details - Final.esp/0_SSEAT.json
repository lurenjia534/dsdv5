Not a soul's seen us entering and it's well hidden from prying eyes, only person we've seen around is an old man in a cabin. So long as we steer clear of him, we should be able to remain hidden, at least for the time being.\r\n\r\nStill can't believe it went down like that. I know Remus was just looking out for us, but it still doesn't sit right with me.\r\n\r\n27th Rain's Hand\r\nWe set up a prison for Remus in case he can't control his urges. Luckily haven't had to use it yet but if he does transform again, it'll save all our heads.\r\n\r\nThings have calmed down at the very least, enough times passed that we can start getting some real rest. Still, we gotta stick to hunting and foraging at night to avoid spooking the old man. Romul claimed he chased a deer down on his own two legs, not that it meant much to me but the others said it's quite the feat.\r\n\r\n8th Second Seed\r\nSilvio managed to gather some mountain flowers, lavender, dragon's tongue, not the greatest selection but it's all we can get out here. The others think it'll be enough to try cleanse Remus' body from Oblivion knows what was in that potion but I'm sure none of it'll work.\r\n\r\nThey still think it's just a bit more hair and a mean streak, they didn't see what he looked like, or what he did to the mage. Remus doesn't care to correct them either, he just spends his time staring at the water below. I see the moons, I think he feels the transformation coming. For our sake, I hope that cell holds him.\r\n\r\n24th Second Seed\r\nOld man got a glimpse of us as we returned from hunting. We put on a good facade, hopefully he just thinks we're travellers.\r\n\r\n5th Mid Year\r\nRemus turned last night.\r\n\r\nHe managed to hold off for a time, let us lock him well before night actually fell. Half soiled myself when I saw it all happen though, his skin bulging, muscles ripping and the veins growing, was the first time I saw it happen clearly. I doubt Remus even knew who we were, had a wildness to his eyes that I only saw on the other night, suppose it's just part of the transformation.\r\n\r\nWe knew the cell would hold but all the howling and rattling he did was bound to send the deer into a frenzy. We can hope all the running that old man does makes him sleep soundly at night, else he might come to investigate.\r\n\r\nPlants are growing nicely though I'm starting to miss the village. Not that it really matters, they wouldn't take us back, not after Remus' bloody stint with the mage. Bastards could only chase us with the pitchforks cause of us, else that wizard would have cast hexes on the lot of them.\r\n\r\n13th Mid Year\r\nMoons are gonna be full soon, need to be careful.\r\n\r\n27th Mid Year\r\nSilvio's dead. Had to barricade ourselves in to stop Remus from getting us.\r\n\r\nIf it happened once, it could happen again. We need to do something.\r\n\r\n2nd Sun's Height\r\nAmul's heard stories of people summoning Clavicus Vile, says he'll get a cure for Remus. Can't shake the idea it's all gonna go wrong, not fancying talking to a brother of the one who caused all this. Still, it's the only chance we have, I suppose it's the only chance we have.\r\n\r\n6th Sun's Height, 4E 201\r\nBeen days since Amul tried contacting the Daedra, no sign of him. \r\n\r\nI've seen the old man walking around the lake recently. Might need to scare him, might make him second guess investigating this.\r\n\r\n9th Sun's Height\r\nSome beggar covered in dirt arrived while we slept, even Remus didn't hear his footsteps. We know he's a messenger for Vile, made it clear enough himself when he was standing above my bed when I awoke.\r\n\r\nBastard named his price, said the old man has to die if Remus wants his humanity back.\r\n\r\nI don't think I can bring myself to do it, will have to speak to the others.\r\n\r\n12th Sun's Height\r\nWe still can't decide, moons are approaching full.

Spent hours howling my lungs out, hoping he'd hear my cries.\r\n\r\nJust this morning, some mangy beggar knocks on my door and says he has a gift for me. He was an ugly feller, stank of the city but in his hands were a pair of expertly crafted wooden legs. Not sure how he made them himself, the finest woodworkers in the Empire couldn't hope to make something like them. Still, the beggar said they would let me wander the woods once more and allow me to walk as I once did.\r\n\r\nThey bend and move as if they were crafted from flesh and bone, and they're mighty warm to the touch. I don't wish to know what magic he put in them but by the Nine he was right, bastards work even better than my old legs! Already killed a deer with no more than the legs and a dagger!\r\n\r\n1st Morning Star, 4E 201\r\nPaid a visit to the nearby lake and after a few hours of waiting, felled a mighty stag. Already started a fire beneath the trees, even used my old legs as kindling. Seeing those cursed things burn did more for me than any mead could.\r\n\r\nI'll sleep under the pines tonight and continue my hunt in the morning. Life is good.\r\n\r\n25th Second Seed, 4E 201\r\nFolks keep passing by the lake, not seen any of their kind before. Seem friendly enough, though I don't want them learning about my new legs, not sure what would happen if they did.\r\n\r\n12th Mid Year, 4E 201\r\nThe dreams have returned, though now I can finally stand up from the pool of blood. I still meet my end of course but it's different, that's what matters.\r\n\r\nTried speaking with some of those people I've been seeing, no luck though. Bastards have something off about them, I know it, might be running a skooma rink nearby. If they try anything, I'll cut them down, that I'm certain of.\r\n\r\n6th Sun's Height, 4E 201\r\nSomething's off. Had a nightmare, quite a bad one too and I awoke with blood on my palm.\r\n\r\nIt's not just me that's troubled, the deer seem affected too. I saw a doe pacing around the lake and when I went to check on it, it led me to a stag with a log through its chest.\r\n\r\nI know it's not that bastard's magic coming back for me but I still can't shake it. Coming on a year since I've had these legs now and it's got me jumpy. Just need a bit of mead to calm me down.\r\n\r\n11th Last Seed, 4E 201\r\nCan't sleep, not with the year coming to an end so soon. Half tempted to burn these legs now but I can't bring myself to do it.\r\n\r\nNeed to leave the house and calm down. Being trapped here won't do me any good.\r\n\r\n19th Last Seed, 4E 201\r\nI'm safe! That bastard hasn't come for me! Waited all day hidden behind that door, if he'd have come for them, only thing he would have got is an axe to his skull.\r\n\r\nI'll celebrate come morning. I fancy a hunt by the lake, might even see if any game travel into that cave. Doesn't matter, I've got the time to do whatever I want!</font>\r\n",

I thought spending more time with you and Lucia would fill the void inside of me, but I was wrong. So I left you two for a time, took more contracts and tried to fill the hole with bloodshed. That's when I died again.\r\n\r\nAfter that, the longing only grew within me. It sucked the joy out of your laugh and the love out of Lucia's eyes. The walks around Whiterun we once adored felt lifeless and mundane. I tried to ignore it at first and assume who I once was. I couldn't.\r\n\r\nEven now, there is something inside of me, a flame of love for the two of you. I hope you know how much that means to me.\r\n\r\nI write this as I ride out of Whiterun; forgive me.\r\n\r\n</font>\r\n",

Not a soul's seen us entering and it's well hidden from prying eyes, only person we've seen around is an old man in a cabin. So long as we steer clear of him, we should be able to remain hidden, at least for the time being.\r\n\r\nStill can't believe it went down like that. I know Remus was just looking out for us, but it still doesn't sit right with me.\r\n\r\n27th Rain's Hand\r\nWe set up a prison for Remus in case he can't control his urges. Luckily haven't had to use it yet but if he does transform again, it'll save all our heads.\r\n\r\nThings have calmed down at the very least, enough times passed that we can start getting some real rest. Still, we gotta stick to hunting and foraging at night to avoid spooking the old man. Romul claimed he chased a deer down on his own two legs, not that it meant much to me but the others said it's quite the feat.\r\n\r\n</font>",

A reduction or an addition, you cannot tell, but its presence alone brings you to your knees. Your vision begins to blur, and one by one, each sound is slowly drowned out with a deafening silence.
